# Copilot Instructions for adventOfCode2025

## Project Overview
- This repository contains solutions for Advent of Code 2025, organized by day and part.
- Each day has its own folder (e.g., `Day 1/`), with subfolders for `Part 1` and `Part 2`.
- Each part contains:
  - A Python script (e.g., `day1_1.py`, `day1_2.py`)
  - One or more input files (usually CSV, e.g., `Day_1_1_input.csv`)

## Key Patterns & Conventions
- **Naming:** Scripts and input files follow the pattern `dayX_Y.py` and `Day_X_Y_Input.csv` where X = day, Y = part.
- **Input Handling:** Each script reads its corresponding input file(s) from the same directory. Use relative paths.
- **No shared libraries:** Each solution is self-contained; avoid cross-day imports.
- **No external dependencies:** Solutions use only the Python standard library unless otherwise specified in the script.
- **Output:** Scripts typically print the answer to stdout. No output files are generated by default.

## Developer Workflows
- **Run a solution:**
  ```sh
  python Day 3/Part 2/day3_2.py
  ```
- **Add a new solution:**
  1. Create a new folder for the day/part if it doesn't exist.
  2. Add the input file(s) and script following the naming convention.
- **Debugging:**
  - Use print statements or a Python debugger (e.g., `pdb`).
  - Test with both real and test input files (e.g., `Day_8_1T_Input.csv`).

## Examples
- To solve Day 9 Part 2, run:
  ```sh
  python Day 9/Part 2/day9_2.py
  ```
- To add Day 11 Part 1, create `Day 11/Part 1/`, add `Day_11_1_Input.csv` and `day11_1.py`.

## Special Notes
- If a part has both a real and a test input, both files are present (e.g., `Day_8_1_Input.csv`, `Day_8_1T_Input.csv`).
- Keep each part's logic independent; do not refactor into shared modules unless a clear pattern emerges across many days.
- No build or test automation is present; all scripts are run manually.

## Key Files & Directories
- `Day X/Part Y/` — Solution scripts and input files for each day/part
- `.github/copilot-instructions.md` — This file (AI agent guidance)

For questions or unclear conventions, review existing day/part folders for examples or ask for clarification.
